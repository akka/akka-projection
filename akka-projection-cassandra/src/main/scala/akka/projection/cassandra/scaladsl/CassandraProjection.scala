   * If the flow filters out envelopes the corresponding offset will not be stored, and such envelope
   * will be processed again if the projection is restarted and no later offset was stored.

   * The flow should not duplicate emitted envelopes (`mapConcat`) with same offset, because then it can result in
   * that the first offset is stored and when the projection is restarted that offset is considered completed even
   * though more of the duplicated enveloped were never processed.
   *
   * The flow must not reorder elements, because the offsets may be stored in the wrong order and
   * and when the projection is restarted all envelopes up to the latest stored offset are considered
   * completed even though some of them may not have been processed. This is the reason the flow is
   * restricted to `FlowWithContext` rather than ordinary `Flow`.
