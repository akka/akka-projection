  # filter out such messages, but it's not possible to guarantee it all the time. This delay adds a small 
  # buffer of time between when the Kafka Source Provider starts up, or when it's assigned a new partition, 
  # to retrieve the map of partitions to offsets to give any projections running in parallel a chance 
  # to drain in-flight messages.
