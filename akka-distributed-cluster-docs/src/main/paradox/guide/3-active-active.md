# Part 3: Active-active

Active-active means that the same shopping cart is in memory in multiple locations, replicas, and can accept updates
in all of those locations, so that a cloud region outage does not block users from continuing to use the service.  

@extref[Akka Replicated Event Sourcing](akka:typed/replicated-eventsourcing.html) stores persisted events in a local database,
without any need for replication capabilities in the database itself, the events are then replicated using gRPC
transport from @extref[Akka Projection gRPC](akka-projection:grpc-replicated-event-sourcing-transport.html).

The shopping cart will be eventually consistent, meaning that an update to a 

## Turning the shopping cart into a Replicated Entity

The API for writing a Replicated Event Sourced entity is mostly the exact same as the Event Sourced Behavior we already
implemented our entity with. 

The events from other replicas will be replicated and are passed to the event handler of the entity
just like events that was written by the shopping cart instance itself, however there is no global ordering of the events, 
so events may be seen in a different order than the wall clock order they happened, and in a different order in each replica, 
especially in circumstances where there are outages or connectivity problems between the replicas.

### Updating the cart contents

Because of this the data structure must always arrive at the same state even if events arrive in a different order. To handle 
this in the shopping cart we replace the `ItemAdded` and `ItemRemoved` events with a single `ItemUpdated` event
with a positive quantity number when items were added and a negative when items were removed: 

Scala
:  @@snip [ShoppingCart.scala](/samples/replicated/shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala) { #itemUpdatedEvent }

Java
:  @@snip [ShoppingCart.java](/samples/replicated/shopping-cart-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.java) { #itemUpdatedEvent }

In the state we keep a map from `itemId` to the current quantity for each product. For each update we see we add the positive or negative
number to the quantity, getting the same number regardless of what order the changes arrived:

Scala
:  @@snip [ShoppingCart.scala](/samples/replicated/shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala) { #stateUpdateItem }

Java
:  @@snip [ShoppingCart.java](/samples/replicated/shopping-cart-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.java) { #stateUpdateItem }


### Checking the cart out

Another, more complex thing to deal with is checking out. When we had only one instance of the cart, it was safe to say that
after a checkout event, no more updates could happen to the shopping cart. With a replicated cart this is no longer the case
as an update could be sent to one replica, and the checkout to another, so that the update arrives to the checked out replica
after it was checked out, even though at the time of the update, the cart was not yet checked out.

We can solve this by turning checkout into a two-step process, where the initial checkout triggers storing a checkout event
per replica, and letting one of the replicas get a designation as leader, completing the checkout once it has seen checkout
events from all replicas.

When we receive a checkout command, we store a `Closed` event which also contains the id of the replica. We can get the "self" replica id
from the @apidoc[akka.persistence.typed.*.ReplicationContext]:

Scala
:  @@snip [ShoppingCart.scala](/samples/replicated/shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala) { #checkoutStep1 }

Java
:  @@snip [ShoppingCart.java](/samples/replicated/shopping-cart-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.java) { #checkoutStep1 }


In the state we keep a set of all replicas where the cart was closed:

Scala
:  @@snip [ShoppingCart.scala](/samples/replicated/shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala) { #checkoutStep1Event }

Java
:  @@snip [ShoppingCart.java](/samples/replicated/shopping-cart-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.java) { #checkoutStep1Event }


After applying the event to the state, we check if one of the other replicas was closed, and in that case we trigger a command to
the shopping cart itself to close also in this replica using the `CloseForCheckout` command. 

If all replicas are closed and this is the designated leader we trigger a `CompleteCheckout` command. Note that this logic
is only triggered if the entity got the event replicated, and not if it is "recovering" - starting after it was stopped and 
is replaying all events stored in the journal: 

Scala
:  @@snip [ShoppingCart.scala](/samples/replicated/shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala) { #checkoutEventTrigger }

Java
:  @@snip [ShoppingCart.java](/samples/replicated/shopping-cart-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.java) { #checkoutEventTrigger }

The logic for leader makes sure to not tie all carts to the same replica as leader, but instead spreading it across the replicas, by basing it of a hash of the id of the cart.
This again uses the @apidoc[akka.persistence.typed.*.ReplicationContext] to access the list of all replicas:

Scala
:  @@snip [ShoppingCart.scala](/samples/replicated/shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala) { #leader }

Java
:  @@snip [ShoppingCart.java](/samples/replicated/shopping-cart-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.java) { #leader }


Note that this still means that while adding and removing can be done in the face of an outage all replicas must be online 
for any shopping cart to be able to close, so it does not give us complete high-availability for the shopping cart.


## Filters

By default, events from all Replicated Event Sourced entities are replicated.

The same kind of filters as described for @ref:[Service to Service](2-service-to-service.md#filters) can be used for
Replicated Event Sourcing.

The producer defined filter, only replicating carts once they reach a certain size:

FIXME filtering carts for RES doesn't really make sense, does it?

Scala
:  @@snip [ShoppingCart.scala](/samples/replicated/shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala) { #init-producerFilter }

Java
:  @@snip [ShoppingCart.java](/samples/replicated/shopping-cart-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.java) { #init-producerFilter }

Consumer defined filters are updated as described in @extref:[Akka Projection gRPC Consumer defined filter](akka-projection:grpc.md#consumer-defined-filter)

Replicated Event Sourcing is bidirectional replication, and therefore you would typically have to define the same
filters on both sides. That is not handled automatically.
