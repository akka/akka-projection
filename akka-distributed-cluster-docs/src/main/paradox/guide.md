# Guide

As a hands-on guide we will step by step implement a distributed shopping cart, where a user can add and
remove items and finally check the selected goods out. 

A shopping cart is a somewhat synthetic example, but, it is a domain we expect 
you will quickly understand, so that we can focus on explaining the various features of Akka Distributed Cluster.
