/**
 * Generic interface to give access to basic JDBC connection operations.
 *
 * A new [[JdbcSession]] will be created for each call to the projection handler. Upon creation a database connection
 * must be created (preferably relying on connection pool) and used through out the live of this instance.
 *
 * After usage, the underlying database connection will be closed (returned to the pool) after committing or rolling back
 * the transaction. It's paramount to configure the connection to NOT use `auto-commit` in order to guarantee that the
 * event handling and offset persistence operations participate on the same transaction.
 *
 * The only requirement to implement a [[JdbcSession]] is to have access to the underlying JDBC [[Connection]].
 * When using plain JDBC, one can initialize a connection directly, but when relying on a JDBC framework like JPA it will depend on the
 * chosen implementation. Hibernate for instance provides indirect access to the underlying connection through a
 * lambda call and therefore can be used (see [[JdbcSession#withConnection]] method). Other JPA implementations may not provide this feature.

   * For implementations based on Hibernate, this method can be rely on Hibernate's  `Session.doReturningWork`.
