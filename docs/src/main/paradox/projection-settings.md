# Projection Settings

A Projection is a background process that continuously consume event envelopes from a `Source`. Therefore, in case of failures, it is automatically restarted. This is done by automatically wrapping the `Source` with a [RestartSource with backoff on failures](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/operators/RestartSource/onFailuresWithBackoff.html#restartsource-onfailureswithbackoff).

By default, the backoff configuration defined in the reference configuration is used. Those values can be overriden in the `application.conf` file or programatically as shown below.
