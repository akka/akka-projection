# Running the Projection

@@@ note

This example requires a Cassandra database to run. 
If you do not have a Cassandra database then you can run one locally as a Docker container.
To run a Cassandra database locally you can use [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run the [`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) found in the Projections project root.
The `docker-compose.yml` file references the latest [Cassandra Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/cassandra).

Change directory to the directory of the `docker-compose.yml` file and manage a Cassandra container with the following commands.

| Action                   | Docker Command |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Run                      | `docker-compose --project-name getting-started up -d cassandra` |
| Stop                     | `docker-compose --project-name getting-started stop` |
| Delete container state   | `docker-compose --project-name getting-started rm -f` |
| CQL shell (when running) | `docker run -it --network getting-started_default --rm cassandra cqlsh cassandra` |

To use a different Cassandra database update the [Cassandra driver's contact-points configuration](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-cassandra/current/configuration.html#contact-points-configuration) found in `./examples/src/resources/guide-shopping-cart-app.conf`.

To run the Projection we must setup our Cassandra database to support the Cassandra Projection offset store as well as the new table we are _projecting_ into with the `ItemPopularityProjectionHandler`.

Create a Cassandra keyspace.

```
CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS akka_projection WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy','replication_factor':1 };
```

Create the Cassandra Projection offset store table.
The DDL can be found in the @ref:[Cassandra Projection, Schema section](../cassandra.md#schema).

Create the `ItemPopularityProjectionHandler` projection table with the DDL below.

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS akka_projection.item_popularity (
item_id text,
count counter,
PRIMARY KEY (item_id));
```

Source events are generated with the `EventGeneratorApp`.
This app is configured to use [Akka Persistence Cassandra](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-cassandra/current/index.html) to persist random `ShoppingCartApp.Events` to a journal.
It will checkout 10 shopping carts with random items and quantities every 10 seconds.
After 10 seconds it will increment the checkout time by 1 hour and repeat.
This app will also automatically create all the Akka Persistence infrastructure tables in the `akka` keyspace.
We won't go into any further detail about how this app functions because it falls outside the scope of Akka Projections.
To learn more about the writing events with [Akka Persistence see the Akka documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/index-persistence.html).

To run the `EventGeneratorApp` use the following sbt command.

```shell
sbt "examples/test:runMain docs.guide.EventGeneratorApp"
```

If you don't see any connection exceptions you should eventually see log lines produced with the event being written to the journal.

Ex)

<!-- FIXME: update when event generator app updated to persist to cart id persistenceids -->
```shell
[2020-07-16 15:13:59,855] [INFO] [docs.guide.EventGeneratorApp$] [] [EventGenerator-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-3] - persisting event ItemAdded(62e4e,bowling shoes,0) MDC: {persistencePhase=persist-evt, akkaAddress=akka://EventGenerator, akkaSource=akka://EventGenerator/user/persister, sourceActorSystem=EventGenerator, persistenceId=all-shopping-carts}
```

Finally, we can run the projection itself by using sbt to run `ShoppingCartApp` in a new terminal.

```shell
sbt "examples/test:runMain docs.guide.ShoppingCartApp"
```

After a few seconds you should see the `ItemPopularityProjectionHandler` logging that displays the current checkouts for the day:

```shell
[2020-08-12 12:16:34,216] [INFO] [docs.guide.ItemPopularityProjectionHandler] [] [ShoppingCartApp-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-10] - ItemPopularityProjectionHandler(shopping-cart) item popularity for 'bowling shoes': [58]
```

Use the CQL shell to observe the full information in the `item_popularity` table.

```
cqlsh> SELECT item_id, count FROM akka_projection.item_popularity;

 item_id       | count
---------------+-------
  akka t-shirt |    37
   cat t-shirt |    34
          skis |    33
 bowling shoes |    65

(4 rows)

```
