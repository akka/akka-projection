(Liberally copied and adopted from Scala itself https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/blob/b11cd2e4a4431de7867db6b39362bea8fa6650e7/notes/releases/template.md)

For every release, make a copy of this file named after the release, and expand the variables.
Ideally replacing variables could become a script you can run on your local machine.

Variables to be expanded in this template:
- $VERSION$=??? 

-->

### before the release

- [ ] Create a new milestone for the [next version](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/milestones)
- [ ] Check [closed issues without a milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20no%3Amilestone) and either assign them the 'upcoming' release milestone or `invalid/not release-bound`
- [ ] Make sure all important / big PRs have been merged by now

### Preparing release notes in the documentation / announcement

- [ ] For non-patch (minor/major) releases: rename the 'akka-projection-x.x-stable' and 'akka-projection-supported-x.x-stable' reporting projects in [WhiteSource](https://saas.whitesourcesoftware.com/Wss/WSS.html) accordingly (unfortunately this requires permissions that cannot be shared outside of Lightbend)
- [ ] For non-patch releases: Create a news item draft PR on [akka.github.com](https://github.com/akka/akka.github.com), using the milestone
- [ ] Move all [unclosed issues](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A$VERSION$) for this milestone to the next milestone
- [ ] Close the [milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date)

### Cutting the release

- [ ] Make sure any running [Travis builds](https://travis-ci.com/akka/akka-projection) for the commit you would like to release have completed.
- [ ] Create the [release notes](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/releases) with the next tag version `v$VERSION$`, title, release description and contributors (the latter generated by [`authors`](https://github.com/2m/authors) (eg. `authors v1.0.1 HEAD`))
- [ ] Check that GitHub Actions release build has executed successfully (GitHub Actions will start a [CI build](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/actions) for the new tag and publish artifacts to Sonatype)

### Check availability

- [ ] Check [reference](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-projection/$VERSION$/) documentation
- [ ] Check the release on [Maven central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/lightbend/akka/akka-projection-core_2.13/$VERSION$/)

### When everything is on maven central
  - [ ] `ssh akkarepo@gustav.akka.io`
    - [ ] update the `current` links on `repo.akka.io` by with the script:
         ```
         ./update-akka-projection-current-version.sh $VERSION$
         ```
    - [ ] check changes and commit the new version to the local git repository
         ```
         cd ~/www
         git add docs/akka-projection/current docs/akka-projection/$VERSION$
         git commit -m "akka-projection $VERSION$"
         ```

### Announcements
